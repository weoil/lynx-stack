/**
 * `WorkletExecIdMap` ensures the worklet object is not released in js context when the main thread is still holding the
 * worklet object (or any of its jsFnHandles). The worklet object holds the js functions which might be called by `runOnBackground()`.
 * If the worklet object is incorrectly released earlier, the `runOnBackground()` would result in failure.
 *
 * Every time a worklet object is sent to the main thread, an `execId` is distributed and will be sent to element
 * context with the worklet object. This relationship is recorded in this class. When all the references to the
 * worklet object are released in the main thread, a message will be sent back to remove the record here.
